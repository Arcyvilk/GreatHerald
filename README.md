# GreatHerald
The **Great Herald** bot got created specifically with the purpose to serve the community of /r/viktormains Discord Server. His job involves simple talk, role management, promoting streamers and providing data accessible via Riot's API, requested by guild members.

Majority of commands can be invoked with the exclamation mark preceeding them - for example ``!help``. There are also several other bot interactions which do not require the ``!`` syntax, for example ``Dear Viktor <text>`` which triggers the yes/no type of response, or specific keywords occuring in the string which trigger the response frm the bot, be it a text message, be it a reaction.
